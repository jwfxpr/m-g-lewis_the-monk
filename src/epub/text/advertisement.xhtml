			<p>The first idea of this Romance was suggested by the story of the Santon Barsisa, related in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Guardian</i>.⁠—The Bleeding Nun is a tradition still credited in many parts of Germany; and I have been told that the ruins of the Castle of Lauenstein, which She is supposed to haunt, may yet be seen upon the borders of Thuringia.⁠—The Water-King, from the third to the twelfth stanza, is the fragment of an original Danish Ballad⁠—And Belerma and Durandarte is translated from some stanzas to be found in a collection of old Spanish poetry, which contains also the popular song of Gayferos and Melesindra, mentioned in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Don Quixote</i>.⁠—I have now made a full avowal of all the plagiarisms of which I am aware myself; but I doubt not, many more may be found, of which I am at present totally unconscious.</p>
